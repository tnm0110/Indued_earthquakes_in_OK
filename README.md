# Wastewater Injection Activities and Induced Earthquakes in Oklahoma

This study demonstrates the application of geospatial analysis using publicly available datasets. By employing GIS analysis techniques, it highlights well-documented phenomena of induced seismicity caused by saltwater injection.
Oklahoma was selected due to its significant increase in seismic activity in recent years. Additionally, I have developed a Jupyter Notebook that can be adapted for similar analyses in other states affected by induced seismicity, such as Kansas and Illinois.

# Project Components
project_induced_seismicity.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook performing data mining and GIS analysis.
project.gdb: The primary geodatabase for this project.
HTML File: An HTML file showcasing the final results is included for easy visualization.
